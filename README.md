## 💡 How It Works

1. **User navigates** to the homepage and browses available dishes.
2. **Items are added** to the cart using JavaScript.
3. On checkout, the cart data is **sent to the PHP backend**.
4. PHP handles the **database operations** and order processing.
5. (Optional) Admins can **view and manage** orders through a dashboard.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prempatel013/VeggieDelight.git

````

2. **Set up your local server**

   * Use XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP.
   * Place the project inside your local server directory (`htdocs/` in XAMPP).
   * Start Apache and MySQL.

3. **Import the database**

   * Locate the SQL file in the project (e.g., `veggiedelight.sql`).

## 🛡️ Security Notes
